1. What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples
import React from 'react';
import imageSrc from './path/to/image.jpg';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={imageSrc} alt="Description" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

2. What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
It will log an array containing the state value and the setter function from the useState hook.

3. How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?
If you don't add a dependency array in useEffect, the effect will run on every render of the component.

● What is SPA?
SPA stands for Single Page Application. In React, SPAs are built where the entire application is contained within a single web page, and navigation and content updates are handled dynamically using React Router or similar libraries.

● What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
->Client-Side Routing: Handles routing within the browser using JavaScript libraries like React Router. Page transitions occur without a full page reload, providing a smoother user experience.
->Server-Side Routing: Involves the server determining which page to serve based on the URL requested by the client. Each navigation typically results in a full page reload from the server.
