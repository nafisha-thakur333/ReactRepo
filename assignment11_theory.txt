Q1) What is prop drilling?
In React,  prop drilling  refers to the process of  passing down props(short for properties) through multiple layers of nested components.This happens when a piece of data needs to be transferred from a higher-level component to a deeply nested child component, and it must pass through several intermediary
components in between.

Q2) What is lifting the state up?
Lifting state up  in React refers to the practice of  moving the state from a lower-level (child) component to a higher-level (parent or common ancestor) component in the component tree . This is done to share and manage state across multiple components.

Q3) What is Context Provider and Context Consumer?
1. Context Provider : The Context Provider is a  component that allows its children to subscribe to a context's changes . It accepts a value prop, which is the data that will be shared with the components that are descendants of this provider. The Provider component is created using  React.createContext()  and then rendered as part of the component tree. It establishes the context and provides the data to its descendants. 

2.Context Consumer : The Context Consumer is a component that subscribes to the changes in the context provided by its nearest Context Provider ancestor. It allows components to access the context data without the need for prop drilling. The Consumer component is used within the JSX of a component to consume the context data. It takes a function as its child, and that function receives the current
context value as an argument.

Q4) If you donâ€™t pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?
Yes, If we don't pass a value to the Provider in React's Context API,  it does use the default value specified when creating the context using React.createContext(defaultValue) .
